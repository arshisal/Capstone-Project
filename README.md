## Topic of Project
## Downtown Toronto Air Quality Prediction Leveraging Environment Canada Data

Air pollution is linked to many health issues such as cardiovascular deaths, heart disease, lung cancer and strokes. 
Large cities are increasingly facing the episodes of critically high levels of air pollution which is affecting the public 
health. Accurate pollution forecasting helps people and health providers to plan ahead and decrease the effects of air 
pollution on health and costs associated.

#### Data Preperation
Since the data that is downloaded from website is in raw format, it is essential to first clean and prepare them. Below Rmd files are the steps to process the raw data.

+ [Data Prep from the Raw Data - Pollutants](https://github.com/arshisal/Capstone-Project/blob/master/Data%20Prep%20Pollutants%20rmarkdown.Rmd)
+ [Data Prep from the Raw Data - Meteorological](https://github.com/arshisal/Capstone-Project/blob/master/Data%20Prep%20Meteo%20Data.R)
#### Technically Correct Data
Technically correct data do not have missing data, categories are not missing and the data is ready for Exploratory Analysis stage. Below Rmd files are details of steps taken to prepare the data to technically correct format.

+ [Technically Correct Data - Pollutants](https://github.com/arshisal/Capstone-Project/blob/master/TCD_Pollutants.Rmd)
+ [Technically Correct Data - Meteorological](https://github.com/arshisal/Capstone-Project/blob/master/TCD_Meteo.Rmd)

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
+ TBD
